**Lectures**: You can obtain all the lecture slides at any point by cloning [2015](https://github.com/cs109/2015), and using `git pull` as the weeks go on.

**Videos**: You can see the entire list of videos [here](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/4283/pages/virtual-classroom). Below we list them by class/section along with a link to the slides.

We've also started a YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0-KaiZFXBlGOFN71YsEV8g/videos) for cs109. This channel has smaller videos dealing with nitty gritty stuff on the course.

**Labs/Sections**: Note that the Lab video and notebook is actually recorded and produced on the Thursday and Friday of the previous week, but is listed under the week that sections pertaining to the material on the Lab are given.
